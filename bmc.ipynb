    "There exist a variety of star-galaxy classification techniques, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we present a novel meta-classification framework that combines and fully exploits different techniques to produce a more robust star-galaxy classification. To demonstrate this hybrid, ensemble approach, we combine a purely morphological classifier, a supervised machine learning method based on random forest, an unsupervised machine learning method based on self-organizing maps, and a hierarchical Bayesian template fitting method. Using data from the CFHTLenS survey, we consider different scenarios: when a high-quality training set is available with spectroscopic labels from DEEP2, SDSS, VIPERS, and VVDS, and when the demographics of sources in a low-quality training set do not match the demographics of objects in the test data set. We demonstrate that our Bayesian combination technique improves the overall performance over any individual classification method in these scenarios. Thus, strategies that combine the predictions of different classifiers may prove to be optimal in currently ongoing and forthcoming photometric surveys, such as the Dark Energy Survey and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.\n",

    "The problem of source classification is fundamental to astronomy and goes as far back as [Messier (1781)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Messier). A variety of different strategies have been developed  to tackle this long-standing problem, and yet there is no consensus on the optimal star-galaxy classification strategy. The most commonly used method to classify stars and galaxies in large sky surveys is the morphological separation ([Sebok 1979](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979AJ.....84.1526S); [Kron 1980](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980ApJS...43..305K); [Valdes 1982](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1982SPIE..331..465V); [Yee 1991](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991PASP..103..396Y); [Vasconcellos et al. 2011](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....141..189V); [Henrion et al. 2011](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.412.2286H)). It relies on the assumption that stars appear as point sources while galaxies appear as resolved sources. However, currently ongoing and upcoming large photometric surveys, such as the [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) and the [Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)](http://www.lsst.org/lsst/), will detect a vast number of unresolved galaxies at faint magnitudes. Near a survey's limit, the photometric observations cannot reliably separate stars from unresolved galaxies by morphology alone without leading to incompleteness and contamination in the star and galaxy samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contamination of unresolved galaxies can be mitigated by using training based algorithms. Machine learning methods have the advantage that it is easier to include extra information, such as concentration indices, shape information, or different model magnitudes. However, they are only reliable within the limits of the training data, and it can be difficult to extrapolate these algorithms outside the parameter range of the training data. These techniques can be further categorized into supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning), the input attributes (e.g. magnitudes or colors) are provided along with the truth labels (e.g. star or galaxy). [Odewahn et al. (1992)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992AJ....103..318O) pioneered the application of neural networks to the star-galaxy classification problem, and it has become a core part of the astronomical image processing software [_SExtractor_](http://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor). Other successfully implemented examples include decision trees ([Weir, Fayyad, & Djorgovski (1995)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995AJ....109.2401W); [Suchkov, Hanisch, & Margon (2005)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AJ....130.2439S); [Ball & Brunner (2006)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010IJMPD..19.1049B); [Sevilla-Noarbe & Etayo-Sotos (2015)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26C....11...64S)) and Support Vector Machines ([Fadely, Hogg, & Willman 2012](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...760...15F)). [Unsupervised machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) techniques are less common, as they do not utilize the truth labels during the training process, and only the input attributes are used.\n",

    "Physically based template fitting methods have also been used for the star-galaxy classification problem ([Robin et al. 2007](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJS..172..545R); [Fadely, Hogg, & Willman 2012](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...760...15F)). Template fitting approaches infer a source's properties by finding the best match between the measured set of magnitudes (or colors) and the synthetic set of magnitudes (or colors) computed from a set of spectral templates. Although it is not necessary to obtain a high-quality spectroscopic training sample,\n",
    "these techniques do require a representative sample of theoretical or empirical templates that span the possible spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of stars and galaxies. Furthermore, they are not exempt from uncertainties due to measurement errors on the filter response curves, or from mismatches between the observed magnitudes and the template SEDs."

We randomly select 13,278 objects for the blind testing set, and use the remainder for training and cross-validation. While HB uses only the magnitudes in the five bands, $u$, $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$, TPC and SOMc are trained with a total of 9 attributes: the five magnitudes and their corresponding colors, $u-g$, $g-r$, $r-i$, and $i-z$.

    "## III. Classification Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we present four distinct star-galaxy classification techniques. The first method is a morphological separation method, which uses a hard cut in the half-light radius vs.\\ magnitude plane. The second method is a supervised machine learning technique named TPC (Trees for Probabilistic Classification), which uses prediction trees and a random forest ([Carrasco Kind & Brunner 2013](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.432.1483C)). The third method is an unsupervised machine learning technique named SOMc, which uses self-organizing maps (SOMs) and a random atlas to provide a classification ([Carrasco Kind & Brunner 2014](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.438.3409C)). The fourth method is a Hierarchical Bayesian (HB) template fitting technique based on the work by [Fadely, Hogg, & Willman (2012)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...760...15F)), which fits SED templates from star and galaxy libraries to an observed set of measured flux values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collectively, these four methods represent the majority of all standard star-galaxy classification approaches published in the literature. It is very likely that any new classification technique would be functionally similar to one of these four methods. Therefore, any of these four methods could in principle be replaced by a similar method. \n",
    "\n",
    "### III.1. Morphological classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest and perhaps the most widely used approach to star-galaxy classification is to make a hard cut in the space of photometric attributes. As a first-order morphological selection of point sources, we adopt a technique that is popular among the weak lensing community. "

    "As figure 1 shows, there is a distinct locus produced by point sources in the half-light radius (estimated by [SExtractor](http://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor)'s FLUX RADIUS parameter) vs. the $i$-band magnitude plane. A rectangular cut in this size-magnitude plane separates point sources, which are presumed to be stars, from resolved sources, which are presumed to be galaxies. The boundaries of the selection box are determined by manually inspecting the size-magnitude diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the disadvantages of such cut-based methods is that it classifies every source with absolute certainty. It is difficult to justify such a decisive classification near a survey's magnitude limits, where measurement uncertainties generally increase. A more informative approach is to provide probabilistic classifications. Although a recent work by [Henrion 2011](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.412.2286H) implemented a probabilistic classification using a Bayesian approach on the morphological measurements alone, here we use a cut-based morphological separation to demonstrate the advantages of our combination techniques. In particular, we later show that the binary outputs (i.e., 0 or 1) of cut-based methods can be transformed into probability estimates by combining them with the probability outputs from other probabilistic classification techniques, such as TPC, SOMc, and HB.\n",

    "We also use a cross-validation technique called Out-of-Bag (OOB; [Breiman 1984](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=mXSv_1UAAAAJ&citation_for_view=mXSv_1UAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C), [Carrasco Kind & Brunner (2013)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.432.1483C)). When a tree (or a map) is built in TPC (or SOMc), a fraction of the training data, usually one-third, is left out and not used in training the trees (or maps). After a tree is constructed using two-thirds of the training data, the final tree is applied to the remaining one-third to make a classification. This process is repeated for every tree, and the predictions from each tree are aggregated for each object to make the final star-galaxy classification. We emphasize that if an object is used for training a given tree, it is never used for subsequent prediction by that tree. Thus, the OOB data is an unbiased estimation of the errors and can be used as cross-validation data as long as the OOB data remain similar to the final test data set. The OOB technique can also provide extra information such as a ranking of the relative importance of the input attributes used in the prediction. The OOB technique can prove extremely valuable when calibrating the algorithm, when deciding which attributes to incorporate in the construction of the trees, and when combining this approach with other techniques.\n",

In astronomical applications, the high-dimensional input data can be magnitudes, colors, or some other photometric attributes.

In a template-fitting approach, we marginalize by summing up the likelihood that a source has the set of magnitudes $\\mathbf{x}$ for a given star template as well as the likelihood for a given galaxy template:\n",

Thus, the probability that a source is a star (or a galaxy) is either the posterior probability itself if a prior is used, or the likelihood itself if an uninformative prior is used. In a Bayesian analysis, it is preferable to use a prior, which can be directly computed either from physical assumptions, or from an empirical function calibrated by using a spectroscopic training sample. In an HB approach, the entire sample of sources is used to infer the prior probabilities for each individual source.\n",

    "We also use a model combination technique known as Bayesian Model Combination (BMC; [Monteith et al. 2011](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6033566&tag=1)), which uses Bayesian principles to generate an ensemble combination of different classifiers. The posterior probability that a source is a star is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P \\left(S | \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{D}, \\mathbf{M}, \\mathbf{E} \\right) = \\sum_{e \\in \\mathbf{E}} P \\left(S | \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{M}, e \\right) P \\left(e | \\mathbf{D} \\right), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{D}$ is the data set, and $e$ is an element in the ensemble space $\\mathbf{E}$ of possible model combinations. By Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability of $e$ given $\\mathbf{D}$ is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  P \\left(e | \\mathbf{D} \\right) = \\frac{P \\left(e \\right)}{P \\left(\\mathbf{D} \\right)} \\prod_{d \\in \\mathbf{D}} P \\left( d | e \\right) \\propto P \\left(e\\right) \\prod_{d \\in \\mathbf{D}} P \\left(d | e \\right). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $P\\left(e \\right)$ is the prior probability of $e$, which we assume to be uniform. The product of $P\\left(d | e\\right)$ is over all individual data $d$ in the training data $\\mathbf{D}$, and $P\\left(\\mathbf{D}\\right)$ is merely a normalization factor and not important.\n",
    "\n",
    "For binary classifiers whose output is either zero or one (e.g., a cut-based morphological separation), we assume that each example is corrupted with an average error rate $\\epsilon$. This means that $P\\left(d|e\\right) = 1-\\epsilon$ if the combination $e$ correctly predicts class $\\hat{y}_i$ for the $i^{\\text{th}}$ object, and $P\\left(d|e\\right) = \\epsilon$ if it predicts an incorrect class. The average rate $\\epsilon$ can be estimated by the fraction $\\left(M_g + M_s\\right) / N$,\n",
    "where $M_g$ is the number of true galaxies classified as stars, $M_s$ is the number of true stars classified as galaxies, and $N$ is the total number of sources. We then have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  P \\left( e | \\mathbf{D} \\right) \\propto  P \\left( e \\right) \\left(1 - \\epsilon \\right)^{N - M_s - M_g} \\left( \\epsilon \\right)^{M_s + M_g}. $$\n",

    "For probabilistic classifiers, we can directly use the probabilistic predictions and write\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  P \\left( e | \\mathbf{D} \\right) \\propto P \\left( e \\right) \\prod_{i=0}^{N-1} \\hat{y}_i y_i + \\left(1 - \\hat{y}_i\\right) \\left(1 - y_i\\right). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the space $\\mathbf{E}$ of potential model combinations is in principle infinite, we can produce a reasonable finite set of potential model combinations by using sampling techniques. In our implementation, the weights of each combination of the base classifiers is obtained by sampling from a Dirichlet distribution. We first set all alpha values of a Dirichlet distribution to unity. We then sample this distribution $q$ times to obtain $q$ sets of weights. For each combination, we assume a uniform prior and calculate $P\\left(e|\\mathbf{D}\\right)$ using the above equations. We select the combination with the highest $P\\left(e|\\mathbf{D}\\right)$, and update the alpha values by adding the weights of the most probable combination to the current alpha values. The next $q$ sets of weights are drawn using the updated alpha values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We continue the sampling process until we reach a predefined number of combinations, and finally compute the posterior probability that a source is a star (or a galaxy). In this paper, we use a $q$ value of three, and 1,000 model combinations are considered. We also use a binned version of the BMC technique, where we use a SOM representation to apply different model combinations for different regions of the parameter space."

    "the four different combination techniques,\n",
    "as well as the individual star-galaxy classification techniques\n",
    "on the CFHTLenS test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### V.1. Classification Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic classification models can be considered as\n",
    "functions that output a probability estimate of each source\n",
    "to be in one of the classes (e.g., a star or a galaxy).\n",
    "Although the probability estimate can be used as a weight \n",
    "in subsequent analyses to improve or enhance\n",
    "a particular measurement ([Ross 2011](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.417.1350R)),\n",
    "it can also be converted into a class label\n",
    "by using a threshold (a probability cut).\n",
    "The simplest way to choose the threshold is to set it to a fixed value,\n",
    "e.g., $p_\\mathrm{cut} = 0.5$.\n",
    "This is, in fact, what is often done (e.g.,\n",
    "[Henrion et al. 2011](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.412.2286H); [Fadely, Hogg, & Willman 2012](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...760...15F)).\n",
    "However, choosing $0.5$ as a threshold is not the best choice\n",
    "for an unbalanced data set, where galaxies outnumber stars.\n",
    "Furthermore, setting a fixed threshold ignores the operating condition \n",
    "(e.g., science requirements, stellar distribution, misclassification costs)\n",
    "where the model will be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### V.1.1. Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have no information about the operating condition\n",
    "when evaluating the performance of classifiers,\n",
    "there are effective tools such as\n",
    "the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve ([Swets 2000](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/better-decisions-through-science/)).\n",
    "An ROC curve is a graphical plot that illustrates the true positive rate\n",
    "versus the false positive rate of a binary classifier\n",
    "as its classification threshold is varied.\n",
    "The Area Under the Curve (AUC) summarizes the curve information\n",
    "in a single number,\n",
    "and can be used as an assessment of the overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### V.1.2. Completeness and Purity\n",
    "\n",
    "In astronomical applications,\n",
    "the operating condition usually translates to\n",
    "the completeness and purity requirements of the star or galaxy sample.\n",
    "We define the galaxy _completeness_\n",
    "$c_g$ (also known as recall or sensitivity) as\n",
    "the fraction of the number of true galaxies classified as galaxies\n",
    "out of the total number of true galaxies,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c_g = \\frac{N_g}{N_g + M_g},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N_g$ is the number of true galaxies classified as galaxies,\n",
    "and $M_g$ is the number of true galaxies classified as stars.\n",
    "We define the galaxy _purity_ $p_g$ (also known as precision\n",
    "or positive predictive value)\n",
    "as the fraction of the number of true galaxies classified as galaxies\n",
    "out of the total number of objects classified as galaxies, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_g = \\frac{N_g}{N_g + M_s},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M_s$ is the number of true stars classified as galaxies.\n",
    "Star completeness and purity are defined in a similar manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages of a probabilistic classification is\n",
    "that the threshold can be adjusted to produce\n",
    "a more complete but less pure sample,\n",
    "or a less complete but more pure one.\n",
    "To compare the performance of probabilistic classification techniques\n",
    "with that of morphological separation,\n",
    "which has a fixed completeness ($c_g = 0.9964$, $c_s = 0.7145$)\n",
    "at a certain purity ($p_g = 0.9597$, $p_s = 0.9666$),\n",
    "we adjust the threshold of probabilistic classifiers\n",
    "until the galaxy completeness $c_g$ matches\n",
    "that of morphological separation\n",
    "to compute the galaxy purity $p_{g}$ at $c_g=0.9964$.\n",
    "Similarly, the star purity $p_{s}$ at $c_{s}=0.7145$\n",
    "is computed by adjusting the threshold\n",
    "until the star completeness of each classifier is equal to\n",
    "that of morphological separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also compare the performance of different classification techniques\n",
    "by assuming an arbitrary operating condition.\n",
    "For example, weak lensing science measurements\n",
    "of the DES require $c_g > 0.960$ and $p_g > 0.778$\n",
    "to control both the statistical and systematic errors\n",
    "on the cosmological parameters,\n",
    "and $c_s > 0.250$ and $p_s > 0.970$\n",
    "for stellar Point Spread Function (PSF) calibration\n",
    "([Soumagnac et al. 2013](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.450..666S)).\n",
    "Although these values will likely be different\n",
    "for the science cases of the CFHTLenS data,\n",
    "we adopt these values to compare the classification performance\n",
    "at a reasonable operating condition.\n",
    "Thus, we compute $p_{g}$ at $c_g=0.960$\n",
    "and $p_{s}$ at $c_s=0.250$.\n",
    "We also use the MSE as a classification error metric."

    "\n",
    "We have presented and analyzed a novel star-galaxy classification framework for combining star-galaxy classifiers using the CFHTLenS data. In particular, we use four independent classification techniques: a morphological separation method; TPC, a supervised machine learning technique based on prediction trees and a random forest; SOMc, an unsupervised machine learning approach based on self-organizing maps and a random atlas; and HB, a Hierarchical Bayesian template-fitting method that we have modified and parallelized. Both TPC and SOMc algorithms are currently available within a software package named [MLZ](http://lcdm.astro.illinois.edu/code/mlz.html). Our implementation of HB and BMC, as well as IPython notebooks that have been used to produce the results in this paper, are available at https://github.com/EdwardJKim/astroclass.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the variety of star-galaxy classification methods we are using, we fully expect the relative performance of the individual techniques to vary across the parameter space spanned by the data. We therefore adopt the binning strategy, where we allow different classifier combinations in different parts of parameter space by creating two-dimensional self-organizing maps of the full multi-dimensional magnitude-color space. We apply different star-galaxy classification techniques within each cell of this map, and find that the four techniques are weighted most strongly in different regions of the map.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Using data from the CFHTLenS survey, we have considered different scenarios: when an excellent training set is available with spectroscopic labels from DEEP2, SDSS, VIPERS, and VVDS, and when the demographics of sources in a low-quality training set do not match the demographics of objects in the test data set. We demonstrate that the Bayesian Model Combination (BMC) technique improves the overall performance over any individual classification method in both cases. We note that [Carrasco Kind (2014)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.442.3380C) analyzed different techniques for combining photometric redshift probability density functions (photo-$z$ PDFs) and also found that BMC is in general the best photo-$z$ PDF combination technique.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of star-galaxy classification is a rich area for future research. It is unclear if sufficient training data will be available in future ground-based surveys. Furthermore, in large sky surveys such as DES and LSST, photometric quality is not uniform across the sky, and a purely morphological classifier alone will not be sufficient, especially at faint magnitudes. Given the efficacy of our approach, classifier combination strategies are likely the optimal approach for currently ongoing and forthcoming photometric surveys. We therefore plan to apply the combination technique described in this paper to other surveys such as the DES. Our approach can also be extended more broadly to classify objects that are neither stars nor galaxies (e.g., quasars). Finally, future studies could explore the use of multi-epoch data, which would be particularly useful for the next generation of synoptic surveys.\n",
