    "# A Hybrid Ensemble Learning Approach to Star-galaxy Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "[MNRAS (2015) 453 (1): 507-521](http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/453/1/507), [arXiv:1505.02200](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02200) [astro-ph.IM]\n",

    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "There exist a variety of star-galaxy classification techniques, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we present a novel meta-classification framework that combines and fully exploits different techniques to produce a more robust star-galaxy classification. To demonstrate this hybrid, ensemble approach, we combine a purely morphological classifier, a supervised machine learning method based on random forest, an unsupervised machine learning method based on self-organizing maps, and a hierarchical Bayesian template fitting method. Using data from the CFHTLenS survey, we consider different scenarios: when a high-quality training set is available with spectroscopic labels from DEEP2, SDSS, VIPERS, and VVDS, and when the demographics of sources in a low-quality training set do not match the demographics of objects in the test data set. We demonstrate that our Bayesian combination technique improves the overall performance over any individual classification method in these scenarios. Thus, strategies that combine the predictions of different classifiers may prove to be optimal in currently ongoing and forthcoming photometric surveys, such as the Dark Energy Survey and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.\n",

    "\n",
    "The problem of source classification is fundamental to astronomy and goes as far back as [Messier (1781)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Messier). A variety of different strategies have been developed  to tackle this long-standing problem, and yet there is no consensus on the optimal star-galaxy classification strategy. The most commonly used method to classify stars and galaxies in large sky surveys is the morphological separation ([Sebok 1979](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979AJ.....84.1526S); [Kron 1980](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980ApJS...43..305K); [Valdes 1982](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1982SPIE..331..465V); [Yee 1991](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991PASP..103..396Y); [Vasconcellos et al. 2011](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....141..189V); [Henrion et al. 2011](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.412.2286H)). It relies on the assumption that stars appear as point sources while galaxies appear as resolved sources. However, currently ongoing and upcoming large photometric surveys, such as the [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) and the [Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)](http://www.lsst.org/lsst/), will detect a vast number of unresolved galaxies at faint magnitudes. Near a survey's limit, the photometric observations cannot reliably separate stars from unresolved galaxies by morphology alone without leading to incompleteness and contamination in the star and galaxy samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contamination of unresolved galaxies can be mitigated by using training based algorithms. Machine learning methods have the advantage that it is easier to include extra information, such as concentration indices, shape information, or different model magnitudes. However, they are only reliable within the limits of the training data, and it can be difficult to extrapolate these algorithms outside the parameter range of the training data. These techniques can be further categorized into supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning), the input attributes (e.g. magnitudes or colors) are provided along with the truth labels (e.g. star or galaxy). [Odewahn et al. (1992)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992AJ....103..318O) pioneered the application of neural networks to the star-galaxy classification problem, and it has become a core part of the astronomical image processing software [_SExtractor_](http://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor). Other successfully implemented examples include decision trees ([Weir, Fayyad, & Djorgovski (1995)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995AJ....109.2401W); [Suchkov, Hanisch, & Margon (2005)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AJ....130.2439S); [Ball & Brunner (2006)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010IJMPD..19.1049B); [Sevilla-Noarbe & Etayo-Sotos (2015)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26C....11...64S)) and Support Vector Machines ([Fadely, Hogg, & Willman 2012](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...760...15F)). [Unsupervised machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) techniques are less common, as they do not utilize the truth labels during the training process, and only the input attributes are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physically based template fitting methods have also been used for the star-galaxy classification problem ([Robin et al. 2007](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJS..172..545R); [Fadely, Hogg, & Willman 2012](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...760...15F)). Template fitting approaches infer a source's properties by finding the best match between the measured set of magnitudes (or colors) and the synthetic set of magnitudes (or colors) computed from a set of spectral templates. Although it is not necessary to obtain a high-quality spectroscopic training sample,\n",
    "these techniques do require a representative sample of theoretical or empirical templates that span the possible spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of stars and galaxies. Furthermore, they are not exempt from uncertainties due to measurement errors on the filter response curves, or from mismatches between the observed magnitudes and the template SEDs."

    "We use photometric data from the [Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLens)](http://www.cfhtlens.org/). This catalog consists of more than twenty five million objects with a limiting magnitude of $i_{\\text{AB}} \\approx 25.5$. It covers a total of 154 square degrees in the four fields (named W1, W2, W3, and W4) of [CFHT Legacy Survey (CFHTLS)](http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Science/CFHTLS/) observed in the five photometric bands: $u$, $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$.\n",

    "We have cross-matched reliable spectroscopic galaxies from the [Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe Phase 2 (DEEP2)](http://deep.ps.uci.edu/), the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 (SDSS-DR10)](https://www.sdss3.org/dr10/), the [VIsible imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (VIMOS) Very Large Telescope (VLT) Deep Survey (VVDS)](http://cesam.oamp.fr/vvdsproject/vvds.htm), and the [VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS)](http://vipers.inaf.it/). We have selected only sources with very secure redshifts and no bad flags (quality flags -1, 3, and 4 for DEEP2; quality flag 0 for SDSS; quality flags 3, 4, 23, and 24 for VIPERS and VVDS). In the end, we have 8,545 stars and 57,843 galaxies available for the training and testing processes. We randomly select 13,278 objects for the blind testing set, and use the remainder for training and cross-validation. While HB uses only the magnitudes in the five bands, $u$, $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$, TPC and SOMc are trained with a total of 9 attributes: the five magnitudes and their corresponding colors, $u-g$, $g-r$, $r-i$, and $i-z$. The morphological separation method uses [_SExtractor_](http://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor)'s  FLUX RADIUS parameter provided by the CFHTLenS catalog.\n",

However, any incompleteness in our knowledge of the template SEDs that fully span the possible SEDs of observed sources may lead to misclassification of sources.\n",

In this section, we provide a brief description of the HB template fitting technique; for the details of the underlying HB approach, we refer the reader to [Fadely et al.

We have also introduced the _hyperparameter_ $\\mathbf{\\theta}$, a nuisance parameter that characterizes our uncertainty in the prior distribution. To compute the likelihood that a source is a star, we marginalize over all star and galaxy templates $\\mathbf{T}$. In a template-fitting approach, we marginalize by summing up the likelihood that a source has the set of magnitudes $\\mathbf{x}$ for a given star template as well as the likelihood for a given galaxy template:\n",

Thus, the probability that a source is a star (or a galaxy) is either the posterior probability itself if a prior is used, or the likelihood itself if an uninformative prior is used. In a Bayesian analysis, it is preferable to use a prior, which can be directly computed either from physical assumptions, or from an empirical function calibrated by using a spectroscopic training sample. In an HB approach, the entire sample of sources is used to infer the prior probabilities for each individual source.\n",
